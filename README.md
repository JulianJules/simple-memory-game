## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp
I used w3schools to help with some of the code

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I did two projects of it, where the first on was the simple one but I realized that it was too simple and I wanted to make it a little more complex so created a new project. Implementing the Time Bar was difficult. At first I wanted to put a designed Bar but it was very difficult for me to connect the time to the bar. After a few hours of not working I used the where the bar that HTML already had. After that it was easier to connect the time to the Bar that will increase every 1s everytime the TIME has decreased by 1s. Making the Custom Mode was difficult. In the beginning I tried to do a scroll bar but I couldn't change the value everytime they scroll. Next I used a drop down menu to pick the different options and then a button to read the value it gets. CSS was probably te most difficult in this project. Positioning everything was hard. I'm not sure if this was the best way but I positioned the menu button, Dropdown menu, and Hearts EMoji using the postion: relative. It was the only was I knew that it would work. Positioning the Game Buttons was not too difficult, I needed a little bit of help to put the Gamebuttons in a 3x3 way. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
  Jut some more information about how CSS connects with the HTML. CSS just confuse me a little bit. I find that CSS and HTML are more of the fron page of the desing and then Javascript is more of the behind the scenes which is what i like the most

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had more time I will add more desing to the Game to make it look better. Probably add some animtation to the website but I don't know that much about CSS it will take me some time to do that. Add custom speed  ot the game so the user can pick any speed they want. Add different speed to each of the levels.
